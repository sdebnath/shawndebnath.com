<p>I am a city slicker who wants to go racing…go figure! Living in apartments is  not the ideal lifestyle for a wanna-be racer, esp. if you don’t have a garage.  And to make matters worse, they are pretty hard to come by around here  (Seattle). Well let me clarify: the ones with electricity and the landlord  allowing you to work on your car kinda garage. Anyhoo, after months of searching  craigslist, I have landed myself in a sweet double car garage not too far from  my place of habitat and best of all…it comes with free electricity! Yay! Time to  get cracking on all the work that I have been too lazy to bother starting.</p>
