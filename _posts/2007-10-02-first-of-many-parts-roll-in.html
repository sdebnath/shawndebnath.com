<p>After much careful thought, the matter has finally been settled. I am jumping  head first into a sport that will undoubtedly be the most thrilling aspect of  my  life as well as the single most expensive activity that I have ever  participated in. If you have been reading along, then you would probably like to  know that I have decided to not rebuild the engine but instead spend the extra  money on buying a better suspension and safety gear. Cause and effect of  listening to Scott H’s stories.</p>
<p>So this past Sunday during one of the local races, I signed a big fat check  over to Carlo (<a title="TC Motorsports" href="mhtml:file://C:UserssdebnathDesktopshawn%20debnath%20Page%201shawn%20debnath%20page%202.mht!x-usc:https://www.tcmotorsports.net/">TC  Motorsports</a>) who is helping me out with ordering all the suspension and  steering components. Among other things ordered was a 3.73 LSD from eBay to  replace the stock 3.73 open differential currently in the car. I am guessing I  will need to switch to 4.10 in a couple years, but hey, I managed to get the  3.73 at a really good price. Also jumped on a really good deal at <a title="Edge Racing" href="mhtml:file://C:UserssdebnathDesktopshawn%20debnath%20Page%201shawn%20debnath%20page%202.mht!x-usc:https://www.edgeracing.com/">Edge  Racing</a>and ordered four Enkei RPF-1 15×7 wheels and Falken/Ziex Ze 912 tires  to wrap them in.</p>
<p>Don’t worry, I won’t keep you hanging for juicy pictures. Here are a few  shots of the LSD which the FedEx man just dropped off. Drool on!</p>
