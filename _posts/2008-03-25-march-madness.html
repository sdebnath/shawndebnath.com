<p>As March rolls on by, I decided to put back the parts on my engine and get it  ready for replacement with the engine thats already in the car. In the next few  weekends when my buddies can help me out, I will get the engine swapped in and  the transmission seals replaced. Then onto suspension, the differential and  lastly the brakes and tires.</p>
