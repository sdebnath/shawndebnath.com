<p>Starting off a blog is perhaps more challenging than I thought it would be.  How do you begin to describe what it feels to get started in the world of  racing…you simply can’t. You have set plans on how you would like to execute but  you have no idea what might obstruct them in the future. If you ask any racer  today, they will all unanimously say that choosing to be a part of the world of  motorsports was one of the best decisions they made in their lives. So with high  hopes and optimism I am putting together my words, my experiences as they  happen…good or bad, for the rest of the world to get a glimpse into the life of  an amateur racer. Welcome aboard!</p>
