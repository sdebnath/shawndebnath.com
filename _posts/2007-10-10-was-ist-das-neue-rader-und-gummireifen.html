<p>Here’s  a quick test for the bavarian fan and you are correct if you read it “What is  that? New wheels and tires?” Came back home this evening only to be delightfully  welcomed by the smell of fresh new rubber! Yuuuuummmm…</p>
<p>You are looking at a set of four Silver Enkei RPF-1 racing wheels wrapped  with Falken/Ziex ZE 912 tires balanced and mounted for free by <a title="Edge Racing" href="mhtml:file://C:UserssdebnathDesktopshawn%20debnath%20Page%201shawn%20debnath%20page%202.mht!x-usc:http://www.edgeracing.com/">Edge  Racing</a>. They were also nice and went ahead and included all the necessary  wheel studs and hub rings for free as well!</p>
