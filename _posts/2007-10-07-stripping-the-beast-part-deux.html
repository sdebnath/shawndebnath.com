<div class="page-post">
<p>Work continued this past week on stripping the rest of the interior of the  car. Started with the sound defeaning pads in the trunk most of which I managed  to freeze with the help of dry ice and then took a hammer to it for a clean and  effective removal strategy. Unfortunately, this approach didn’t work as well as  I would have liked it to for the interior pads. So I bought myself a heat gun as  suggested by some of the fellow racers and went at it. Several minutes of gluey  nirvana later I decided to stop the process and continue it later in an open  aired environment. Mike you were right about the buzz.</p>
<p>Unwilling to call it quits so soon, I diverted my focus on fun things such as  removing the steering wheel and dash so that I could get to the rat’s nest  (wiring harness) below. I am quite sick and tired of unwanted components and  wanted to start working on removing them from the car. Among the first things to  get ripped out was the Viper alarm system which was no longer operational since  the last stripping effort.  This also forced me to learn how to solder when I  realized that the alarm system had its wires deeply entangled with the OEM  harness. The unwanted A/C tubes were next in line to be removed. As Sunday  evening approached I decided to finally call it a quit and promised to start  again early next week with a clean up of around the heater core and removing the  A/C subsystem from the car. If time permits I will start digging into  identifying and removing unwanted wires from the several harnesses inside the  car.</p>
