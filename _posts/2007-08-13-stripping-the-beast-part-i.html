<p>On a whim, my friend Matt and I decided it’s about time to strip the interior
of the 325i after I wanted to relocate the sub and amps from the 3-series to my
5-series. From what was supposed to take 15 mins ended up taking a day and a
half and we ended up with a mostly stripped 325i exposing its bare red skin to
all those who dare to glance.  All that are left are the A/C components, roof
liner and noise reducing pads…but that’s for another weekend. As always, here
are some pictures from the event…Matt’s dog seems to like the new interior quite
a bit :) </p>
