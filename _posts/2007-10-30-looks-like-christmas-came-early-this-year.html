<p>With much excitement I stopped by TC Motorsports this morning to pick up my  suspension and steering upgrades. The sight of the new Koni coilover racing  suspension (assembled by TrueChoice) along with the sway bars and strut/shock  tower braces left a grin that spanned the width of my face. It’s hard to believe  that even as adults, you sometimes get to go back down memory lane and  experience once again what it is like to be a kid on Christmas morning. Thanks  to Carlo at TC Motorsports for “hooking” me up.</p>
