			I'm a software engineer currently working on a scalable database system at eBay,
			with a focus on PostgreSQL internals, high availability, and petabyte-scale data management.
		</p>
		<p>
			Previously, I spent several years at Amazon Web Services, where I helped
			launch Aurora PostgreSQL and delivered core components including Serverless V1/V2,
			performance optimizations, and availability improvements.
			Earlier in my career, I worked at Sun Microsystems and Microsoft, tackling storage and
			database engine challenges across UFS, Windows, SQL Server, and SQL Azure. In 2013,
			I stepped away from big tech to co-found a few startups before returning to large-scale
			systems.

		<p>
			I have contributed to the <a href="http://amzn.to/2joaGIe">Solaris
			Internals</a> book and exploring writing one of my own.
